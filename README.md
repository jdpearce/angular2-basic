# angular2-basic

A minimalist angular2 project created from scratch. No bells or whistles.

The intent was to create a project with as few moving parts as possible so it would be obvious what was necessary 
and that what it takes to add new features.

This version includes AoT compilation with the the [@ultimate/aot-loader](https://github.com/UltimateAngular/aot-loader).

Current build process is no longer clunky!

To install :

    git clone https://github.com/jdpearce/angular2-basic
    cd angular2-basic
    npm install

To build :

    npm run build
